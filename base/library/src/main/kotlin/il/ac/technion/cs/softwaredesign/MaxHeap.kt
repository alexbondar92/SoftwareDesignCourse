/**
 * MaxHeap of <[String]>. sorted by score (int) and then by addition order (older is bigger)
 * Implemented by [MaxHeapImpl] that based on the secureStorage
 * you can use it to store the million users â˜º
 * added million users in 20 seconds! changed the scores and get top10 in another 5 seconds!
 *
 * Every max heap has a unique id (allow it to use private sector on the storage),
 * and you can get it by [getId] to restore max heap instance with [MaxHeapFactory.restoreMaxHeap].
 * secureStorage Latency (in millis):
 * * [add] - no latency (price for that - dont add element that already exist!)
 * * [remove] - O(log n) * the max length of element name
 * * [getScore] - the length of the element name + log10(Score) + log10(n)
 * * [changeScore] - O(log n) * the max length of element name
 * * [topTen] - O(1)
 * * [isEmpty] - no latency
 * * [nonEmpty] - no latency
 * * [count] - no latency
 * * [getId] - no latency
 *
 * @see MaxHeapImpl to see how it works
