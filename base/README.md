(This is important for people who switched partners, but everyone needs to fill it out)

## Library selection
This submission uses the library identified by the number: 5

## Notes

### Implementation Summary
We have used the data structures from the library for that assignment.
In addition we used the courseApp listeners system for the data that 
the bots are getting as user that is inside the channels and listen 
for all the messages inside. for every "statistics" of the bot we 
create listener for that purpose.

### Testing Summary
We decided to use the implementation of courseApp from the previous assignment 
for testing the new bot API. 

### Difficulties
It was interesting to understand, read, use and refactor the libraries of someone else.


### Feedback
great idea to do this represent of the library between the groups
